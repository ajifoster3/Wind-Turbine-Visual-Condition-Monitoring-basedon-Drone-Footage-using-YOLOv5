abstract = {Summary
Given the decline in investment costs for renewable energy technologies, other cost components have become increasingly important. In 2017, operations and maintenance (O&M) accounted for 20\%–25\% of lifecycle costs for wind and solar plants in Europe, but the understanding of O&M dynamics is limited. Presenting new data from Germany, here, we consider cumulative operating experience to estimate O&M experience curves for onshore wind and solar photovoltaic (PV). Results indicate O&M cost reductions with each doubling of cumulative experience of 9.2\%–12.8\% for onshore wind and of 15.7\%–18.2\% for solar. Drawing on expert interviews and archival information, we describe mechanisms regarding how O&M experience led to lower costs, including economies of scale, upsizing, learning by doing, and learning by using and learning by interacting, comparing both technologies. Moreover, regulatory changes fostered competitive pressure toward cost reductions. Our results suggest that dynamic cost reduction potentials for O&M need to be considered in energy system planning, modeling, and optimization.}

The defect detection is a composite task of classification and location, leading to related methods is often hard to take into account the accuracy of both. The implementation of defect detection depends on a special detection data set that contains expensive manual annotations. In this paper, we proposed a novel defect detection system based on deep learning and focused on a practical industrial application: steel plate defect inspection. In order to achieve strong classification ability, this system employs a baseline convolution neural network (CNN) to generate feature maps at each stage, and then the proposed multilevel feature fusion network (MFN) combines multiple hierarchical features into one feature, which can include more location details of defects. Based on these multilevel features, a region proposal network (RPN) is adopted to generate regions of interest (ROIs). For each ROI, a detector, consisting of a classifier and a bounding box regressor, produces the final detection results. Finally, we set up a defect detection data set NEU-DET for training and evaluating our method. On the NEU-DET, our method achieves 74.8/82.3 mAP with baseline networks ResNet34/50 by using 300 proposals. In addition, by using only 50 proposals, our method can detect at 20 ft/s on a single GPU and reach 92\% of the above performance, hence the potential for real-time detection.}, publisher={Loughborough University}, author={He, Yu and Song, Kechen and Meng, Qinggang and Yan, Yunhui}, year={2019}, month={May}
